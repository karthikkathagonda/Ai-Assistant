Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, what":

```
print("Hello, what")
```

When you run this program, it will display the text "Hello, what" on the screen.

You can also use string formatting to insert a variable into the printed text. For example:

```
name = "Karthik"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

This will print "Hello, Karthik" on the screen.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
