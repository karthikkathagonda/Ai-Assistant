Here is a Java program that prints "Hyderabad" on the screen:

```
public class Hyderabad {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hyderabad");
    }
}
```

This program defines a class called `Hyderabad` and a main method. The main method is the entry point of the program and is where the code inside the method is executed when the program is run.

The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the string "Hyderabad" on the screen.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
